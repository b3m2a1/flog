    For breadcrumbing and other things, we use a list of site URLs.
    This can be expensive to generate so we cache it.
    When adding new files we need to regenerate it.
    Uncomment the following to remake the YAML for it.
  <pre>
urls: {% for url in all_page_urls %}
 - {{url}}{% endfor %}
  </pre>

  {% endcomment %}
  {% include breadcrumbs.html %}
</div>
